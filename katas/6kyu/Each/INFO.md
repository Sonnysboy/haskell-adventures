In this task, you need to write a function "each" that takes an integer number n and an input list of integers (possibly empty) and returns a list of n-th elements of the source list or an empty list. The first element of the list has the number 1. See examples for details.
Examples

each 0 [1,2,3,4,5,6] = []  
each 1 [1,2,3,4,5,6] = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
each (-1) [1,2,3,4,5,6] = [6,5,4,3,2,1]  
each 2 [1,2,3,4,5,6] = [2,4,6]  
each (-2) [1,2,3,4,5,6] = [5,3,1]  
each 3 [1,2] = []  
each (-3) [1,2] = []  
each 5 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] = [5]  
each (-5) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] = [3]
