-- RULES:
{-
Along with your solution for each task you must include a com-
ment explaining your solution and how it works. Solutions with-
out an explanatory comment will get a score of zero. Your com-
ment should demonstrate a complete understanding of your solu-
tion. In other words, anything is fair game but you must demon-
strate that your understand how it works. If in doubt, include
more detail.
• Comments do not count towards the length of your solutions.
• Type signatures do not count towards the length of your solutions.
• import statements do not count towards the length of your so-
lutions. You may import any modules included in the Haskell
Platform.
• Whitespace does not count towards the length of your solutions.
So there is no need to shove all your code onto one line and take
all the spaces out. Use space as appropriate, indent nicely, etc., but
otherwise try making your code as short as you can.
cis 194: homework 3 2
• You are welcome to include additional functions beyond the ones
required. That is, you are welcome to break up your solutions into
several functions if you wish (indeed, sometimes this may lead to
a very short solution). Of course, such additional functions will be
counted towards the length of your solution (excluding their type
signatures).
• Your final submission should be named Golf.hs. Your file should
define a module named Golf, that is, at the top of your file you
should have

A local maximum of a list is an element of the list which is strictly
greater than both the elements immediately before and after it. For
example, in the list [2,3,4,1,5], the only local maximum is 4, since
it is greater than the elements immediately before and after it (3 and
1). 5 is not a local maximum since there is no element that comes
after it.

Exercise 3 Histogram
For this task, write a function
histogram :: [Integer] -> String
which takes as input a list of Integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive),
and outputs a vertical histogram showing how many of each number
were in the input list. You may assume that the input list does not
contain any numbers less than zero or greater than 9 (that is, it does
not matter what your function does if the input does contain such
numbers). Your output must exactly match the output shown in the
examples below.

histogram [1,1,1,5] ==
